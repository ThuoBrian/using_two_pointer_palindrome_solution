## LeetCode Solution with Benchmarking using Criterion Crate
This repository contains the solution to the two pointer pandrome in LeetCode problems, implemented in Rust. 
Each solution is paired with a benchmark using the Criterion crate, providing performance testing to ensure the efficiency of the algorithms. 
The goal is to optimize for both correctness and speed.
