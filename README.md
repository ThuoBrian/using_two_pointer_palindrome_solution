## LeetCode Solution with Benchmarking using Criterion Crate

This repository contains a solution to the **Two Pointer Palindrome** problem from LeetCode, implemented in Rust.  
The solution is paired with benchmarks using the **Criterion crate**, providing performance testing to evaluate the efficiency of the algorithm.  
The goal is to optimize both correctness and speed.

### Features:
- **LeetCode Problem**: Two Pointer Palindrome solution.
- **Benchmarking**: Performance benchmarks using the **Criterion crate** to test execution time and resource usage.
- **Optimized**: Focus on both algorithm correctness and efficiency.
